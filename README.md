# MaleNameGeneratorRNN
Project to learn RNNs and shows the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate male names based on patterns learned from a dataset of names.
  Key Features:
    
    Character-level RNN: The model is trained at the character level, meaning it learns patterns in sequences of characters to generate new names.  
    
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Cells: LSTM layers are used to capture long-term dependencies in sequences of characters.
    
    Name Generation: After training, the model can generate new names by predicting characters one at a time, starting from a seed character.
